# 🔊 Text-to-Speech Feature

## Overview

The FSL Translator now includes **automatic text-to-speech** that reads the translation aloud when you stop collecting signs!

---

## ✨ How It Works

### Automatic Speech
1. Click "Start Collecting Signs"
2. Perform your signs
3. Click "Stop & Translate"
4. **Translation appears AND is read aloud automatically!** 🔊

### Toggle On/Off
- **Checkbox**: "🔊 Read translation aloud"
- **Checked** (default): Translation is spoken
- **Unchecked**: Silent mode (text only)

---

## 🚀 Setup

### Install TTS Library
```bash
pip install pyttsx3
```

Or install all requirements:
```bash
pip install -r app_requirements.txt
```

### That's It!
- No API keys needed

- Uses your system's built-in TTS engine

```

### Example 2: Question
```
1. Collect signs: HOW → ARE → YOU

## ⚙️ TTS Settings

The app uses these default settings:
- **Speed**: 150 words per minute (natural pace)
- **Volume**: 90% (clear but not too loud)
- **Voice**: Your system's default voice

### Want to Change Settings?

Edit `fsl_translator_app.py` around line 100:

```python
self.tts_engine.setProperty('rate', 150)    # Speed (100-200)
self.tts_engine.setProperty('volume', 0.9)  # Volume (0.0-1.0)
```

**Speed Options:**
- `100` - Slow (easier to understand)
- `150` - Normal (default)
- `200` - Fast (quicker)

**Volume Options:**
- `0.5` - Quiet
- `0.9` - Normal (default)
- `1.0` - Maximum

---

## 🎯 When TTS Speaks

### ✅ TTS Activates When:
- You click "Stop & Translate"
- Translation is generated (by Gemma or simple mode)
- Checkbox is checked
- Signs were detected

### ❌ TTS Does NOT Activate When:
- Checkbox is unchecked
- No signs were detected
- You click "Clear All"
- You're still collecting signs

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "TTS initialization failed"
**Windows:**
```bash
pip install pyttsx3
pip install pywin32
```

**Mac:**
```bash
pip install pyttsx3
pip install pyobjc
```

**Linux:**
```bash
pip install pyttsx3
sudo apt-get install espeak
```

### No sound / Voice not working
1. **Check system volume** - Make sure it's not muted
2. **Check checkbox** - "🔊 Read translation aloud" should be checked
3. **Test system TTS** - Try other TTS apps to verify it works
4. **Restart app** - Close and reopen the application

### Voice sounds robotic
- This is normal for system TTS
- Different operating systems have different voice quality
- Windows 10/11 has better voices than older versions

### Want a different voice?
```python
# Add this code to see available voices:
voices = self.tts_engine.getProperty('voices')
for voice in voices:
    print(voice.name)

# Set a specific voice:
self.tts_engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)  # Try different indices
```

## 🎨 UI Elements

### Checkbox Location
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [▶ Start Collecting Signs]        │
│  ☑ 🔊 Read translation aloud        │  ← TTS Toggle
│  [🗑️ Clear All]                     │

```

### Status Messages

- **"Signs displayed (no AI)"** - TTS speaking simple translation
- **"No signs detected"** - No TTS (nothing to speak)

## 💡 Tips

### For Best TTS Experience:
1. **Use Gemma AI** - Natural sentences sound better than word lists
2. **Complete sentences** - "Hello! Good morning!" sounds better than "HELLO GOOD MORNING"
3. **Adjust volume** - Set comfortable level for your environment
4. **Quiet environment** - Easier to hear the translation

### For Presentations:
1. **Check TTS before starting** - Make sure it works
2. **Adjust speed** - Slower for audiences
3. **Increase volume** - Louder for larger rooms
4. **Test with sample signs** - Verify voice quality
