# FSL Translator App - Changes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Camera Black Screen** ✅
- **Problem**: Complex queue system was causing video display issues
- **Solution**: Simplified to use thread-safe frame storage with lock
- **Result**: Camera now displays properly with smooth video feed

### 2. **Slow Sign Detection** ✅
- **Problem**: Queue overhead and complex threading was slowing down predictions
- **Solution**: Reverted to simpler approach similar to working test_live.py
- **Result**: Fast, responsive sign detection like before

### 3. **Incomplete AI Replacement** ✅
- **Problem**: SentenceBuilder class was defined but not integrated
- **Solution**: Completely removed all Gemma/AI references and integrated SentenceBuilder
- **Result**: Clean, simple sentence building without any API dependencies

## What Changed

### Removed:
- ❌ All Gemma AI integration code
- ❌ Ollama dependencies
- ❌ Google Generative AI imports
- ❌ "Gemma AI Status" UI section
- ❌ Complex queue-based video processing
- ❌ API token requirements

### Added/Improved:
- ✅ Simple `SentenceBuilder` class for natural sentence construction
- ✅ Thread-safe frame storage with lock mechanism
- ✅ Simplified video processing (like test_live.py)
- ✅ Styled landmark drawing (colored connections)
- ✅ Faster prediction pipeline
- ✅ Clean, focused UI without AI status section

## How It Works Now

1. **Camera**: Always on, continuously processing frames
2. **Detection**: Fast sign detection using stabilizer (like before)
3. **Collection**: Button controls when to collect signs for translation
4. **Translation**: Simple rule-based sentence builder
   - Converts underscores to spaces
   - Handles common phrases (GOOD_MORNING → "Good morning")
   - Adds proper punctuation (? for questions, ! for greetings, . for statements)
   - Capitalizes first letter
5. **TTS**: Reads translation aloud when "Stop & Translate" is clicked

## Example Translations

Input Signs → Output Sentence:
- `HELLO` → "Hello!"
- `GOOD_MORNING` → "Good morning!"
- `HOW ARE_YOU` → "How are you?"
- `THANK_YOU` → "Thank you."
- `NICE_TO_MEET_YOU` → "Nice to meet you."

## Performance

- **Video**: ~33 FPS display rate
- **Detection**: Real-time, no lag
- **Translation**: Instant (no API calls)
- **TTS**: Non-blocking (runs in separate thread)

## Dependencies

Only standard libraries needed:
- tkinter (UI)
- opencv-python (camera)
- mediapipe (pose detection)
- tensorflow/keras (model)
- pyttsx3 (text-to-speech)
- PIL (image display)
- numpy (arrays)

No API keys, no tokens, completely offline!
