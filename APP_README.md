## ⚙️ Configuration

### Adjusting Detection Sensitivity

Edit these values in `fsl_translator_app.py` (lines 23-25):

```python
# More strict (fewer false positives)
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.75  # Higher
STABILITY_WINDOW = 20        # Larger
MIN_SIGN_DURATION = 25       # Longer

# More lenient (faster detection)
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.55  # Lower
STABILITY_WINDOW = 10        # Smaller
MIN_SIGN_DURATION = 15       # Shorter

# Default (balanced)
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.65
STABILITY_WINDOW = 15
MIN_SIGN_DURATION = 20
```
